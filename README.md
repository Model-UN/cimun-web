# CIMUN XVIII

Hello! Welcome to the repository for the CIMUN XVIII web application. This is an
open-source [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project developed and maintained by
the volunteer-run CIMUN Department of Technology.

Chicago International Model United Nations (CIMUN) is an annual inter-scholastic
(high school) Model UN conference in Chicago, IL. Our focus is to create realistic 
educational opportunities for young leaders in the scholastic MUN community.
We are organized by the Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO).

This project is the first iteration of hopefully many projects from the CIMUN
engineering team to provide future conference organizers with the tools necessary
to organize Model UN conferences for the 21st Century.

Our FE stack uses Next.js, React, and TypeScript in order to create exciting
front-ends for conference attendees, as well as Model UN-specific, CRM-like
administrative tools for conference organizers and stakeholders.

The project here, as well as the projects on the
[model-un](https://github.com/model-un) GitHub organization page are all **open source**,
licensed under the [GNU GPL v2](./LICENSE) license.

This project uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=model-un&utm_campaign=oss) for all
our continuous deployment needs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
